    <p>
        In the world, dogs are one of the most common domestic animals. They’re also listed as one of the most friendly
        pets around that people own. They’re usually described as man’s best companions because they generously offer
        their friendship and company to people.

        Among other pets, dogs are the most intelligent ones. They have an acute sense of understanding that is better
        than that of other animals. This makes it possible for them, as a result of their sharp sense of sight, smell,
        and hearing, to easily detect or sense the feelings, emotions, and body language of their human companions.

        Out of all the pets you can own, dogs are the most protective. They’ll always stand for you whenever they sense
        any danger around you.
